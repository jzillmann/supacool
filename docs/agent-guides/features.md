# Feature index — what exists and where it lives

One dense page mapping every shipped subsystem to its primary files, so nobody (human or
agent) has to rediscover a feature from source. **Maintenance rule**: when you ship a
feature or materially reshape one, update its row here in the same commit (see
`AGENTS.md` § Documentation system). Names are real file names — `fd <name>` finds them.

Rows with `—` in the deep-doc column are documented only by this index and their code;
if you find yourself explaining one at length in a PR or session, that's the signal to
promote it to its own page under `docs/agent-guides/`.

The human-facing feature list in the root [`README.md`](../../README.md) is the marketing
view of this same table — when you add a row here, check whether the README deserves the
bullet too (and vice versa). `docs-lint` checks both.
